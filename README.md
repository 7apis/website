# Sample website
<<<<<<< HEAD
A sample website for "Learn Enough Git to be Dangerous". I am just messing around a bit trying to get the hang of Git Bash, Vim, and command line. Then I'm supposed to ship this website out into the world. Oh, how far I've come. 

Some things that make me happy:
1. Pomegranate seeds
2. Heavy rain
3. Macarons in pastel colors
4. String quartets (especially those with good viola parts)
5. Soft, comfy sweaters
